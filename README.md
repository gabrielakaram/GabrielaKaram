## Hi there 👋
🎓 My name is Gabriela Karam, I'm a Bachelor's student in **Biological Sciences** at the **University of São Paulo, Brazil**.

🐍 I’m currently using **Bayesian statistics and machine learning approaches** to infer aspects of the macroevolution of **Serpentes**, with a focus on **diversification** rates!
